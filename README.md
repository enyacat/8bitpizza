# 8 bit pizza - a React Pizza shop
- This is a pizza shop, 8 bit style, can be accessed here https://eight-bit-pizza.herokuapp.com/. My intention was to remake a pizza shop website http://pizza2go.net.au/

## Available Scripts

As the website is already there, I didn't use a wireframe. The goal is to integrate as much of the ordering functions as possible: display menu, add pizza, select/deselect toppings, select sizes and etc.

## What's not there
The paying function is not there. The "deals" detail selection was not there.

## Bugs
When you open another pizza, the previous pizza's topping choices are still there. CSS bugs include font display when changing screen size.

## Acknowlegement
An online pizza shop tutorial by Udemy helped me a lot, despite their much simpler data structure. I managed to display default topping and extra toppings correctly. Great thank you to my instructor DT from General Assembly Australia. It's been a great 12 weeks of learning with you. Thanks to my parents and husband who have supported me through this immersive course.
